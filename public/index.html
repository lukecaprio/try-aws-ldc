      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <p><span><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />ODOR JUDGE</span></p>
<p>In order to test the effectiveness of new products, â€˜odor judgesâ€™ are hired to smell volunteersâ€™ breath, feet, and armpits. They make sure their judgment is accurate, the members of staff have their sense of smell tested monthly. Letâ€™s hope those products are doing the trick, for the judgesâ€™ sake!Â </p>
<p>Â Salary estimates for an odor judge range between $19,000 and $52,000, based on the levels of stink.</p>
<p>Companies that have odor judges pertain to personal beauty, urinal cakes, and practical prank fart sprays.</p>
<p>As stated before the level of stank determines the salary of an odor judge. Therefore, the stanky a smell is the higher the salary of the stank smeller.Â </p>
<p>Minimal Requirements:Â The minimum qualifications to become an odor tester includeÂ <span>a bachelor's degree in chemistry</span>. Some employers prefer applicants with experience in the relevant industry; for example, to be an odor tester for a fragrance company, employers prefer you have previous experience in the beauty industry.</p>
